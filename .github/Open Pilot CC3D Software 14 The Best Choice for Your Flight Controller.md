Open Pilot CC3D is a flight controller board that can be used for various multirotor and fixed wing aircraft. It has a powerful STM32 32-bit microcontroller running at 90MIPs with 128KB Flash and 20KB RAM. It also features a 3-axis MEMS gyro and accelerometer, a flexible port for GPS or telemetry modules, and an onboard USB port for easy configuration and firmware updates.

In this article, we will show you how to install or update Open Pilot CC3D software 14, which is the latest stable release of the Open Pilot project. This software includes many improvements and bug fixes over the previous versions, such as better support for CC3D/Atom boards, improved flight performance and stability, and new features like OneShot ESC support and GPS flight modes.
 
## Step 1: Download Open Pilot CC3D Software 14
 
The first step is to download the Open Pilot CC3D software 14 from the official website[^1^]. You can choose between Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux versions depending on your operating system. The download file is a zip archive that contains the Ground Control Station (GCS) software, the firmware files for different boards, and some documentation.

## Step 2: Install Open Pilot GCS
 
The next step is to install the Open Pilot GCS software on your computer. This is the program that allows you to configure and tune your CC3D board, as well as update its firmware. To install the GCS, simply extract the zip file you downloaded and run the setup.exe file (for Windows) or drag the OpenPilot.app file to your Applications folder (for Mac OS X). Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation.
 
## Step 3: Connect Your CC3D Board
 
Now you need to connect your CC3D board to your computer using a mini-USB cable. Make sure you have a battery plugged in to your aircraft as well, as some boards may not power up properly without it. You should see a green LED on your board indicating that it is powered on and connected.
 
## Step 4: Update Your Bootloader
 
Before you can update your firmware to version 14, you need to check and update your bootloader version if necessary. The bootloader is a small program that runs on your board when you plug it in and allows you to flash new firmware. If you have an older bootloader version than 4, you will not be able to use the new firmware.
 
To check your bootloader version, open the Open Pilot GCS and go to the Firmware tab. With your board unplugged, click the Rescue button. Then plug in your board and wait for a few seconds. You should see a message like "Device connected: OPBL v4" or similar. If you see v4 or higher, you are good to go. If you see v3 or lower, you need to update your bootloader.
 
To update your bootloader, follow the instructions on this page[^1^]. You will need to download a specific bootloader file for your board (CC, CC3D/Atom, OPLink or Revo) and use a special tool called DFUSe Demonstration to flash it. This process may vary depending on your operating system and board type, so please read carefully and follow the steps exactly.
 
## Step 5: Update Your Firmware
 
Once you have updated your bootloader (or if you already had v4 or higher), you can proceed to update your firmware to version 14. To do this, go back to the Firmware tab in the GCS and click the Upgrade & Erase button. Follow the on-screen instructions to select your board type and firmware file. The firmware file should be located in the Firmware folder inside the zip file you downloaded earlier. For example, for CC3D boards, it should be called opfw\_cc3d.opfw.
 
The GCS will then flash the new firmware to your board and erase all your previous settings. This may take a few minutes, so please be patient and do not disconnect your board until it is done. You should see a message like "
